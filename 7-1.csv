,"Note: These votes are on passage of the resolutions in the House, not on adoption of the conference report. Beginning with the FY1983, Congress has adopted only one budget resolution each year, rather than the two originally prescribed by the Congressional Budget Act.",,,,,,
,"a. The third resolution for FY1980 was part of the first resolution for the FY1981, but it was voted on separately in the House.
b. Although both chambers passed a FY1999 budget resolution, the two different versions were so far apart that Congress never seriously attempted to reconcile the two bills, so that FY1999 was the first year under the Congressional Budget Act that Congress did not pass a budget resolution.
c. The house passed a ""budget enforcement resolution"" in FY2011 to substitute for a traditional budget resolution.
d. In January 2017, Congress adopted a ""shell"" budget resolution for FY2017 for the purposes of initiating the reconciliation process in FY2017.
e. The House did not take a vote on a budget resolution for FY2019.",,,,,,
